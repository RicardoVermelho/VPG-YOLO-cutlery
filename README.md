# VPG-YOLO-cutlery

This repository contains an adaptation of Visual Pushing-for-Grasping, available at https://github.com/andyzeng/visual-pushing-grasping,
to work with cutlery objects in simulation. It features the object detection model YOLO version 5, which helps with the detection of the types of objects in
the table of the simulation and also features, a sorting system to separate forks from knives and spoons.
